Set is a game where 81 cards have symbols with different colors, shapes, number and filling. A Set is three cards where every feature is either all the same, or all different. Grab as many Sets as you can find: the player with the most cards at the end wins!

Here are a few things that are already implemented:

🤖 AI mode: play against the computer in easy, medium or hard difficulty!  
💡 In-game tutorial: onboard with a simple tutorial to discover the rules (easy to understand, hard to master!)  
📱 Cross-device playability: you should be able to play on your computer, tablet or smartphone!  
🎨 Palettes: this game relies on color vision, but has built-in color palettes for people with color vision impairments. You can also build your own custom palette, and share it with a single click!  
🔊 Bleep, bloop: funny sounds are definitely involved (of course you can turn these off)

Here's a roadmap of some features that I'd like to implement in the future:

⚡ Versus mode: play against your friends!  
☕ Zen mode: play with no opponent, no timer, and no score.  
⌨️ Accessibility: more accessibility features, such as 100% keyboard playability.  
🏆 Leaderboards: born to win? This will be your place to shine.

In fact, you may have played the physical version of this board game before: Set was designed by Marsha Falco in 1974, and published by Set Enterprises in 1991.
